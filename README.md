# IndividualFileRelease

The shell script allows you to create an individual file release in case you
have no command line access to your webspace. It replaces the file releases
that were previously done for Semantic MediaWiki 2.4.x to 2.5.x.

This individual file release includes MediaWiki core, the Vector skin as well
as the utmost essential semantic extensions Semantic MediaWiki, Semantic
Result Formats, Semantic Extra Special Properties as well as Semantic Compound
Queries.

Note that you still have to adapt your wiki's "LocalSettings.php" file as well
as create the required database tables.
